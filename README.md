# stremio-local-files

## [OBSOLETE] - replaced by https://github.com/stremio/stremio-local-addon

## Stremio add-on that scans local video files

### How to set this up?

```bash
npm install stremio-local-files
cd node_modules/stremio-local-files
npm start
open http://localhost:3033/stremio/v1
# click "Activate add-on"
```

### Where will I see my files?

When clicking ``Play`` on a movie/episode in Stremio, you'll see "Local File" entry in ``Available Streams`` if there is a local video file for that item found.

To see all that is being found locally, open ``Settings`` -> ``Import from disk``.
